 <p>Hello everybody,&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>My name is&nbsp;Tushar&nbsp;Mahendra&nbsp;and I am 23 years old. I have graduated from University Of The Fraser Valley with Bachelor of Computer Information Systems and Professional Communication Essentials associate certificate. Due to small class sizes, I have been privileged to work closely with the professors in my Computer Science labs and Communication classes.&nbsp; I have had exceptional performance in programming, web development and statistics which has given me a great experience in games, websites development and manage databases. I also pursued public speaking, project management and professional communications. These courses equipped me with hands on experience in communicating professionally to academic, workplace audience and public speaking. Due to my exceptional academic achievement I&nbsp;was able to get my name in the Dean's List in 2019.</p> 
 <p>I work as an IT Service Desk Technician at Save-On-Foods Head Office. We focus on assisting the stores remotely and sending out the communication to the stores around Canada. I worked with my professor Russell Campbell in collaborating gaming projects in my Object Oriented Course. I developed a program called Email Spam Filter and wrote an algorithm that works closely to sort the spam emails and important emails using Python in my Extreme Computing course. I investigated in Advance Topics: Forensic Computing</p> 
 <p>I indulged myself in sport activities from a young age. I have been part of Chandigarh Cycling Club and represented my city in 15th National Mountain Biking Championship, 2018 Pune, Maharashtra. I also participated in swimming and football tournaments during my early days in high school.</p> 
 <p>The CIS program at University of the Fraser Valley provided me a great opportunity to understand the concepts of different programming languages and work in practical&nbsp;environment by implying code in programs designed by different authors.&nbsp;My&nbsp;goal is to pursue Artificial Intelligence and bring a change in the future of AI.&nbsp;</p>
